				<h2 class="about_header">About Me</h2>
				<p class="about_content">Born in Maryland in a family of artists and now a sculpture teacher at Charlotte Country Day School, Jaclyn Orchard has been an artist her whole life. While in college, she discovered her love for working with clay. Jaclyn was attracted to overcoming the challenges that came with working with a medium so tactile and frustrating. In addition to liking the challenge of clay, she also loves the usefulness and interaction she can have with a finished piece. After graduating from Towson University in 2005 with an art major with an emphasis on ceramics, Jaclyn began her teaching career. After teaching art at an all-girls school in Maryland, she moved to North Carolina and began her new job at Charlotte Country Day School. Currently, she teaches Sculpture 1-4 classes as well as AP level classes and independent studies. In addition to being a full-time teacher, Jaclyn Orchard is also a mother of two and the current board president for the Carolina Clay Matters potter's guild for North and South Carolina. Jaclyn began selling her artwork through her business Creative Orchards at the guild's biannual pottery festival. She hopes that she can help promote pottery and revive the love of art within the younger generations in North Carolina.</p>
